# My Open Source Libraries

I love open source, both using it and also giving back.

## In Progress

### BitMEX API Library

I'm working on the BitMEX API at the moment, as I see it can be a powerful tool for hedging volatility of my bitcoin holdings (and also making a bit of money when trading at high leverage through speculation).

Right now I'm getting together the structure of the API library, and finding out the feasibility of getting what I need done.

Eventually my goal is to have a trading bot make enough money to be able to be self sufficient (as in not pay for the hosting service), then maybe eventually become another passive income stream.

### Github Commit API - Improvements

I wish to add some [more improvements](https://github.com/nolim1t/create_github_commit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) for this, as there's a lot of potential here.

Eventually, I'd like to support other services like **GitLab** and **BitBucket** if there's an API as well because I love decentralization (which is what attracted me to cryptocurrencies, and digital nomadism).
